Welcome to my portfolio site. I built it using GatsbyJs. It features a theme toggle in the navbar that persists in local storage. Since so many components rely on the theme state for styling, I used React's context API which made the state very easy to access. I implemented a smooth scroll feature to the navbar to make navigation functional and snappy. Animation were built with Framer Motion. Content is stored using markdown files and queried with GraphQL.
