title: ABOUT ME
description: I'm Adam Wilder.

Aerospace welder turned front end web developer. I started programming in the summer of 2020, learning Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I then dove into React, which led to building my own projects with GatsbyJs and NextJs and eventaully winning freelance clients.

Being a lead welder in the aerospace industry, I learned many skills that are applicable to programming. Building things that go to space and keep commercial jets in the air, you develop an acute attention to detail. Collaborating with engineers to develop specialized components honed my communication skills over the years. I managed and trained a team of up to eight other aerospace welders to ensure our parts were of the highest quality and shipped out on time, challenging my time management and soft skills.

Outside of programming, I'm a guy in his mid thirties that still skateboards. I also love rock climbing, building computers, and my derp of a dog, Lemmy.
